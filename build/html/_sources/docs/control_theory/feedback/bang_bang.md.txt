# Bang-Bang Control

The simplest controller. If your target is in front of you, go forwards (with a constant output). If it's behind you go backwards (with a constant output). 

In more technical terms, apply a constant output negative to the sign of the error.

One problem with bang-bang control is that since it does not slow down
as it gets to the target, it will consistently overshoot. Once it
overshoots, it will go in the opposite direction and overshoot again,
oscillating and never reaching the target and coming to a stop like we
want it to.
