## Installation

Follow WPILib’s [<u>installation guide</u>](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) to install it.

It’s a really large file and will take a long time to download, so I’d
recommend downloading at home.

I’d also recommend pinning the application to a doc or keeping a
shortcut on your desktop. It’s time consuming to dig through all your files to find the app otherwise.

If you already have the normal version of VSCode downloaded, I’d
recommend renaming the WPILib version to ‘WPILib VSCode \<year\>’ so you can tell them apart.
