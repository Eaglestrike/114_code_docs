# Setup

1.  You need to [<u>install git/ check for installation</u>](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
2.  [<u>Create a github account</u>](https://github.com/signup?source=header) (do not recommend using your school email)
3.  Set up an ssh key for your account
## How to set up an SSH key

If you only have one github account, you should [<u>check if you already
have an ssh
key</u>](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)
on your machine.

If you do not already have an ssh key, OR you use multiple github accounts, you should [<u>generate an ssh key using
ssh-agent</u>](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

Now once you have an ssh key, you should [<u>add it to your
account</u>](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
and then [<u>verify its
connected</u>](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection).

Managing ssh keys with multiple accounts is pretty complicated so I’m
not going to cover it here but if you’re interested I can show you how
to set it up.
