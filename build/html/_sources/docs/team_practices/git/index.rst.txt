Git and Github
==============

In order for the whole team to work on a single code project, we have to
use some sort of software to manage multiple people making changes to
one file or set of files. For this, most of the world (our team
included) uses git and GitHub.

git allows people to work on developments while preserving the latest
working version, revision and restoration of version, and easy . Itâ€™s
essentially like google drive for code.
