# The Purpose of Code

From the codeâ€™s POV, the robot is composed of moving parts like motors and pneumatics, and sensors like cameras, and inputs from the driver. 

Coding is about utilising and integrating all the information given by the sensors and driver input to make the moving parts move. This is how the robot functions. 

Basically code moves the robot to do what we want.
