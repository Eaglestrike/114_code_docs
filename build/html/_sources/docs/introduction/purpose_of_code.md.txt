# The Purpose of Code
From the code’s POV, the robot’s composed of **moving parts**: motors
and pneumatics, sensors: cameras, encoders and miscellaneous other
parts, and inputs from the driver. Coding is about utilizing and
integrating all the information given by the sensors and driver input to
make the moving parts move—that is how the robot functions. As such, to
actually make working code on the robot, a coder (you) must understand
how each part functions.
