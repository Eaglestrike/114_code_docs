# What is a vendor library?

The robot is comprised of things like motors and sensors which are produced and distributed by external vendors. 

These vendors create software libraries so that people can easily use their hardware. 

Basically these libraries allow us to use products like motors and sensors and easily retrieve and send data to them.
