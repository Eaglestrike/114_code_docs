# Informal Prerequisites

Keep in mind that a lot of this can be learned on the go so if you don’t
know everything don’t sweat it. I’ve also provided links to learn these
things with c++ syntax for those of you who know the concepts in other
languages.

### Code knowledge (C++ specific)
  - Basics
    - primitive data types, if statements, variables, switch statements,for loops, while loops
    - [<u>vectors</u>](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vector-in-cpp-stl/)/arrays, functions, printing to console (std::cout \<\< “text” \<\< std::endl)
  - Scope
    - [<u>Access specifiers</u>](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_access_specifiers.asp#:~:text=public%20%2D%20members%20are%20accessible%20from,be%20accessed%20in%20inherited%20classes.), (public/private/protected)
  - Object oriented programming
    - [<u>Classes</u>](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_classes.asp), [<u>inheritance</u>](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-c/) (C++ supports [<u>multiple inheritance</u>](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-inheritance-in-c/)  unlike Java), [<u>constructors</u>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/constructors-cpp?view=msvc-170)
    - Encapsulation (creating meaningful classes) and abstraction (keeping internal stuff hidden) are practices we follow but not super important and will improve the more you code
  - Data structures
    - [<u>Namespaces</u>](https://cplusplus.com/doc/oldtutorial/namespaces/), [<u>Enums</u>](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/enumeration-in-cpp/)
  - Optional stuff that will be useful later
    - [<u>Structs</u>](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_structs.asp) if you’re extra. It’s basically the same thing as a class but we use them like little folders for variables. If that’s confusing, ask me and I’ll show you an example.
    - [<u>Virtual functions</u>](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-function-cpp/) (basically c++ equivalent of an abstract method in Java)
    - [<u>Pointers vs references</u>](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointers-vs-references-cpp/) (and [<u>passing by reference</u>](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp-functions-pass-by-reference/))

### Basic physics
  - Kinematics: know what position, velocity, and acceleration are
    - [<u>Lecture Video</u>](https://youtu.be/198u1x8TBTo)
  - Know that friction exists and always opposes motion
  - Know that gravity exists and acts on an object’s center of mass

### FRC
- Know how the games work
	- Autonomous, Teleop

Knowing calculus is helpful but not necessary

Keep in mind anything you don’t know can pretty easily be found online, especially for syntax stuff and coding concepts. If you come across something and you don’t know what it is, **look it up. The internet is your most valuable resource.**

That being said, these docs are written with the assumption the reader understands most of the things mentioned at a very basic level.
