# The Purpose of Code

From the code’s POV, the robot is composed of moving parts like motors and pneumatics, and sensors like cameras, and inputs from the driver. 

Coding is about utilising and integrating all the information given by the sensors and driver input to make the moving parts move—that is how the robot functions. 

Basically code serves to answer one question:
**How do we move the robot to do what we want?**
