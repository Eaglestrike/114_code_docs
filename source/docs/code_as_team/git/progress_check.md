# Progress check

Even if you think you are familiar with git, try the following to make sure you have the right access rights to the team's codebase.

1. Pull some repository from our team’s GitHub account, for example [2024 robot code](https://github.com/Eaglestrike/2024-RobotCode)
2. Make a new branch
3. Checkout that branch
4. Make a new file or some random change
5. Stage your changes (git add)
6. Commit your staged changes
7. If it’s **not the team’s repository**, try pushing your changes to the branch
8. If you pushed, check github and see if the remote repository is updated and the same as your local one
