# WPILib VScode

VScode is a code editing software that WPILib has built off of with
robotics and FRC in mind. WPILib VScode is the software we use to write
and edit all our code, manage projects, to build code, deploy code on
the robot, and more.

## Installation

Follow WPILib’s [<u>installation
guide</u>](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html) to install it.

It’s a really large file and will take a long time to download, so I’d
recommend **downloading at home**.

I’d also recommend **pinning the application** to a doc or keeping a
shortcut on your desktop. It’s time consuming to dig through all your files to find the app otherwise.

If you already have the normal version of VSCode downloaded, I’d
recommend renaming the WPILib version to ‘WPILib VSCode \<year\>’ so you can tell them apart.
