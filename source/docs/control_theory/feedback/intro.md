# Feedback Control

Feedback control usually is the most intuitive type of control, as it is
what us humans do. We respond to the environment around us and change
our movement accordingly.

The code changes how the robot behaves, which impacts the sensor data,
which then is fed back into the robot code, hence the name “feedback”.
