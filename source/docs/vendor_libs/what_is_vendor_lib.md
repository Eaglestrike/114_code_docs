# What is a vendor library?

The robot is comprised motors and sensors which are produced and distributed by external vendors. 

These vendors create software libraries so that people can easily use their hardware. 

Basically **vendor libraries allow us to use products like motors and sensors** and make it really simple to retrieve and send data to them.
