# What is a vendor library?

Basically the robot is comprised of things like motors and sensors which are produced and distributed by vendors. These vendors create libraries compatible with WPILib so that we can use them to access the data and features of their products. Basically this allows us to retrieve and send data to stuff like motors on the robot.
